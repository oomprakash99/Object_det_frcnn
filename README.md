# Object_det_frcnn
A PyTorch implementation of  'Occlusion Object detection using Faster R-CNNâ€™


### Preparation

#### Requirements: Python=3.9.16 and pytorch=1.13.1, Anaconda=22.11.1 , numpy=1.23.5 , ipykernel=6.19.2


1. Install Anaconda and [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) and other requirements and libraries

2.The whole project has been trained with kaggle dataset from (https://www.kaggle.com/code/shaikafroz0016/starter-fruit-images-for-object-ef0ac57b-3/data?select=train_zip)

3.Download and change the path to the folders in ipynotebook.

### Train and Test

###4.You may need to run "python3 engine.py install" before training.

5.Requirements are commented in the code in order to train and test.
